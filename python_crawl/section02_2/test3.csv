"In this article I will guide you through a web scraping and data visualization project. We will extract e-commerce data from real e-commerce websites then try to get some insights out of it. The goal of this article is to show you how to get product pricing data from the web and what are some ways to analyze pricing data. We will also look at how price intelligence makes a real difference for e-commerce companies when making pricing decisions. Finally, you will learn how web scraped data can shape your Christmas pricing strategy.This is the simple process we are going to follow for this article:In a real life project you’d probably know which websites you want to get data from. For this article, I’m choosing some popular European e-commerce stores.When scraping product information we have endless amount of data types we could get from an e-commerce site: product name, product specific attributes, price, stock, reviews, category etc. For now, we will focus on four fields that have the potential to give us the most interesting insights:Before we start writing code to extract data from any website, it’s important to make sure we are scraping ethically. First, we should check the robots.txt file and see if it allows us to visit the pages we want to get data from.Example robots.txt:Some things you could do to be compliant:This is the part where we fetch the data from the website. We’re going to use several modules of the Scrapy framework like Item, ItemLoader and pipeline. We want to make sure that the output is clean so we can insert it into a database for later analysis.We are using Scrapy, the web scraping framework for this project. It is recommended to install Scrapy in a virtual environment so it doesn’t conflict with other system packages.Create a new folder and install virtualenv:"
"As you know we held the  last month. During the talks, we had a lot of questions from the audience. We have divided the questions into two parts - in the first part, we will cover questions on Web Scraping at Scale - Proxy and Anti-Ban Best Practice, and Legal Compliance, GDPR in the World of Web Scraping. Enjoy! You can also check out the full talks on these topics A: As both antibots as well as bot developers have access to similar tools, there will be a constant ebb and flow and never a complete stop to web scraping.A: We handle all types of datacenter proxies from multiple providers to ensure a diverse pool for every use case. Our proxy pools are in the order of hundreds of thousands, while that's an important figure, we are constantly focusing on delivering successful responses to our customers.A: While Crawlera does provide browser profiles, going forward there will be more features built under the hood which will help with more sophisticated anti-bots.A: By crawling responsibly. Using .A: We use headless browsers and all browsers can be detected as bots.A: It requires careful inspection of the response body, headers and at times the entire network traffic to understand the behaviour of the underlying anti-bot. We do use some internal tools to identify the type of detection used. There are also open source tools like ""don't fingerprint me"" which allow you to assess the browser fingerprinting used by the website.A: Yes they are and antibot companies do have a signature directory which is able to identify inconsistencies in the request headers."
"We’ve just released a  which makes it easy to integrate AutoExtract into your existing Scrapy spider. If you haven’t heard about  yet, it’s an AI-based web scraping tool which automatically extracts data from web pages without the need to write any code. .This project uses and. A is strongly encouraged.This middleware should be the last one to be executed so make sure to give it the highest value.These settings must be defined in order for AutoExtract to work."
", we answered some of the best questions we got during . In today’s post we share with you the second part of this series. We are covering questions on Web Scraping Infrastructure and How Machine Learning can be used in Web Scraping.Spider unit testing is difficult because it depends on the actual website which you don't have control over. You can use  for testing.Currently, the only tool that is specifically designed for web scraping and to render javascript is . Another option can be to use a headless browser like selenium.In  we use NoSQL database for data storage. One of the advantages of NoSQL is the lack of schema which means you can change Scrapy item definition at any time without any problems.It depends on the project. In some projects there is a dedicated QA team that checks data, in some projects there is no such need. Sometimes it is enough to add automated checks for typical problems, and only do data checks after some major spider update.It depends on the client’s needs. If they need a screenshot of some page as the user sees it they will always need javascript rendering. If they need some content from the website, it is difficult or may be impossible to detect which site needs javascript rendering and which don't."
"In today’s article we will extract real estate listings from one of the biggest real estate sites and then analyze the data. Similar to our previous , I will show you a simple way to extract web data with python and then perform descriptive analysis on the dataset.We are going to use python as a programming language.Tools and libraries:Although this could be a really complex project as it involves web scraping and data analysis as well, we are going to make it simple by using this process:Let’s start!For every web scraping project the first question we need to answer is this - What data do we exactly need? When it comes to real-estate listings, there are so many data points we could scrape that we would have to really narrow them down based on our needs. For now, I’m going to choose these fields:These data fields will give us freedom to look at the listings from different perspectives.Now that we know what data to extract from the website we can start working on our spider.We are using Scrapy, the web scraping framework for this project. It is recommended to install Scrapy in a virtual environment so it doesn’t conflict with other system packages."

"Price scraping is something that you need to do if you want to extract pricing data from websites. It might look easy and just a minor technical detail that needs to be handled but in reality, if you don’t know the best way to get those price values from the HTMLs, it can be a headache over time.In this article, first, I will show you some examples where price scraping is essential for business success. We will then learn how to use our open-source python library, . This library was made specifically to make it easy to extract clean price information from an e-commerce site.If you’re at the beginning of your web scraping journey, here are some examples to give you inspiration on how price-scraping can help you.The e-commerce world has become very noisy and competitive. Companies are searching for ways to raise margins, cut expenses and ultimately display prices that increase their overall revenue the most. This is where competitor price monitoring comes in. There’s no real online retail seller that doesn’t monitor competitor prices on a daily basis in one way or another. Price scraping is a big part of this task - extracting real-time data from millions of price points on a regular basis.Another huge use case of price scraping is brand monitoring. When your brand is visible on multiple platforms online, maintaining price compliance for your product is as important as keeping an eye on the competitor’s pricing. You would ideally want to scrape the product pages that display your products (i.e. your resellers) as well as the competitor’s product data to make sure your pricing strategy is up to date. This would help you establish a competitive price and keep the pricing policy violators in check.You would also want to scrape prices if you do any kind of e-commerce market research. Whether it’s a one-time project or an ongoing one, if you scrape multiple web pages with different price strings it’s important to find a solution for effectively extracting pricing data.At Scrapinghub we’ve developed our own open-source library for price scraping. You can find it on GitHub, as . It is capable of extracting price and currency values from raw text strings.You want to use this library for two important reasons:"

In this blog post, you are going to learn how backconnect proxies work and when you should use them.Before we get into the details of backconnect proxies it’s important to understand the different types of proxies. Here’s a summary:So, first of all, we can refer to proxies based on the IP address type:A backconnect proxy network can be a set of any of these or even a combination of these.Knowing what kind of address you need for your web scraping project is important. You can read more about IP address types in our !We can also group proxies together based on their quality:Public proxies are free and can be used by anyone. Hence, the quality is poor and you probably can’t use them to scale your web scraping. Dedicated proxies are the best for web scraping. Only you can access them and you have all the control over them.Finally, we can define proxies based on if they are managed proxies or not:Now let’s see the difference between these two types."
